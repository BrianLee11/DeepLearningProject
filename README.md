# Introduction
This project is for Deep Learning Spring 2024 Final Project. A novel deep model is developed and compared with other benchmark methods in time series forecasting. All these models are tested in wind power forecasting task.

Wind power is one of the most installed renewable energy resources in the world, and the accuracy of wind power forecasting method directly affects dispatching and operation safety of the power grid.
